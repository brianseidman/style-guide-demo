      <h2 id="numbers-numerals">numbers, numerals</h2>

<p>In general, spell out one through nine and use figures for 10 or above.</p>

<p>Exceptions: Use figures for credit hours, ages and whenever preceding a unit of measurement; always spell out numbers at the start of a sentence (except for years).</p>

<p><em>The Tide finished first. He had nine laps to go. Fourth grade, the First Amendment, the 11th annual county fair, fifth century, 21st century. A 5-year-old boy</em>, but <em>the boy is 5 years old</em>. <em>The student is in his 70s.</em> <em>EN 101 is a 3-credit-hour course. Students must complete 30 credit hours.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dates, years and decades:</strong> <em>Class of ’66, the 1950s, Feb. 8, 2007</em>. Use a comma to set off the year when the phrase refers to a month, date and year. <em>They won the championship on January 9, 2017, and everyone celebrated.</em></p>

<p><strong>Grade point averages:</strong> Use figures for grade point averages. Always include the decimal point and carry to at least one decimal place (2.0); when citing several GPAs, extend them all to the same (highest) decimal place (2.18, 4.00).</p>

<p><strong>In a series:</strong> Apply the standard guidelines mentioned above: <em>They had 10 dogs, six cats and 97 hamsters. They had four four-room houses, 10 three-room houses and 12 10-room houses.</em></p>

<p><strong>Military ranks:</strong> <em>1st Sgt. Jane Smith</em>, but <em>Smith was a second lieutenant.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ranges:</strong> <em>Every two to three weeks</em>, but <em>a two-to-three-week session</em> (if the numbers are part of a compound modifier). Be careful not to confuse numerical ranges with suspensive hyphenation. A numerical range would be, “They ran five-to-10-minute laps” (the laps were anywhere from five to 10 minutes); suspensive hyphenation indicates separate items, like “They alternated between five- and 10-minute intervals.”</p>

<p><strong>School grades:</strong> Spell out first through ninth grades: <em>fourth grade, fifth-grader</em> (note hyphen). Use figures for grades 10 and above: <em>10th grade.</em></p>

<p><strong>Test scores</strong>: Use figures for SAT, ACT and similar test scores. Use figures in constructions such as SAT-1. Do not add commas to SAT or other scores that reach into the thousands: <em>Her GRE composite score was 2070</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Times:</strong> Use figures for time of day except for noon and midnight: <em>1 p.m., 10:30 a.m., 5 o’clock</em>. Spell out numbers less than 10 standing alone and in modifiers: <em>I’ll be there in five minutes. The two-minute warning.</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>With parenthesis:</strong> In general, a spelled-out number does not also need the figure in parentheses. In cases where this is necessary (for instance, customary on Program Development program plans), numbers one through nine (or any spelled-out number that starts a sentence) can be followed by the figure in parenthesis if the number is being compared: <em>We enrolled eight (8) students in the fall, a 33 percent increase from six (6) students in the spring,</em> but <em>We held one information session in the fall.</em></p>
