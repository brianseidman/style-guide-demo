Always use figures (the number, not spelled out) for ages. Use hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun: _A 5-year-old boy_, but _the boy is 5 years old_. _The boy, 7, has a sister, 10._ _The woman, 33, has a daughter 2 months old._ _The race is for 3-year-olds._ _Many distance students are in their 60s_ (no apostrophe).[^1]
